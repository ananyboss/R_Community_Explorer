"My thought is a binomial test of some kind, but I'm struggling how to best account for a) low samples for each individual (tests repeated ~10x with ea, but some trials bats didn't make a choice) &amp; b) account for the repeated measures when looking at all bats #rstats #statstwitter","1522917078","1247673270859694080",2020-04-07 23:51:03,2
"I want to know: 

1) did each individual do better than chance in the two choice test (one side \"correct\", the other \"incorrect) and, 

2) Did all tested bats, on average, do better than chance in the assay (accounting for repeated tests).
